      # Potential edge case:
      #
      # It is possible for older updated_at values to written to the database
      # after this API has been queried for changes. This would mean that these
      # changes are missed when the client makes a subsequent request using the
      # next-link.
      #
      # Possible causes of older updated_at values:
      # - delay between c# calculating datetime.UtcNow and value being written
      #   to postgres
      # - clock drift between servers
